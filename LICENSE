something this easily regenerated would be like copyrighting a
particular arrangement of refrigerator magnets.

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, PLEASE DIRECT YOUR COMPLAINTS TO:

  (a) THE COMPANY THAT BUILT THE CODING AGENT THAT WROTE THIS,

  (c) THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS WHO FUNDED THE WHOLE OPERATION,

WHICHEVER IS MOST CONVENIENT. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU
CONTACT US. WE JUST WROTE THE PROMPT.
