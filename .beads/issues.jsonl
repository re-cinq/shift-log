Evaluate each feature gap to determine if claudit should replicate, skip, or take a different approach.\n\n## Open-Source Features to Evaluate\n\n1. **Multi-agent support** — Agent abstraction layer supporting Claude Code + Gemini CLI. Claudit is Claude-only. Question: is multi-agent worth the complexity, or is deep Claude integration a strength?\n\n2. **Auto-commit strategy** — Continuous checkpointing after every agent response. Claudit only captures on `git commit`. Question: would auto-checkpointing add value or just noise?\n\n3. **AI-powered session summarization** — Summaries capturing intent, outcomes, friction at commit time. Question: how much value vs our current notes approach?\n\n4. **Checkpoint-based rewind** — `entire rewind` restores to any checkpoint, not just commits. Question: is this substantially better than git-based rewind?\n\n5. **Git worktree support** — Independent session tracking across worktrees with conflict warnings. Question: how common is worktree usage in target audience?\n\n6. **Attribution trailers** — Git trailers linking commits to AI sessions. Question: useful for audit/compliance? Easy win?\n\n7. **Session state machine** — Formal phase/state management. Question: does claudit need more formal lifecycle management?\n\n8. **Transcript chunking** — Breaks large transcripts into pieces (claudit uses gzip). Question: any advantage over our compression approach?\n\n## Announced (Not Shipped)\n\n9. **Universal semantic reasoning layer** — Multi-agent coordination. Vaporware for now.\n10. **AI-native UI** — No details. Ignore until shipped.\n\n## Deliverable\nFor each feature: recommend adopt/skip/defer with rationale.","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"daniel@ajps.limited","created_at":"2026-02-10T12:18:41.481929671-08:00","created_by":"Daniel Jones","updated_at":"2026-02-10T12:20:27.835686929-08:00","deleted_at":"2026-02-10T12:20:27.835686929-08:00","deleted_by":"Daniel Jones","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}
